## Deployment
### Docker
Utilized for robust containerization, Docker encapsulates the application in a lightweight, portable container. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments, simplifying dependencies and deployment processes.

### Heroku
Harnesses Heroku for efficient application deployment and management. This PaaS simplifies hosting by automating scaling, load balancing, and monitoring, thus minimizing infrastructure complexity. Heroku's seamless integration with containers and its extensive add-ons ecosystem support a streamlined deployment process, ensuring scalable and responsive web applications with reduced overhead.

### GitHub Actions
Employs GitHub Actions for an automated, seamless deployment pipeline. This CI/CD tool triggers deployments directly from the repository to AWS Elastic Beanstalk upon committing/merging to the main branch. It ensures that the portfolio is always up-to-date in the production environment, facilitating effortless updates and expansions with minimal manual intervention.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Removed from AWS due to monthly cost)
Leverages the power of AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment and management. This service automates the deployment of applications to the cloud, managing scaling, load balancing, and monitoring, thereby reducing the complexity of infrastructure management.
