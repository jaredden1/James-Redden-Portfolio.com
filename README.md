## Deployment
### Docker
Utilized for robust containerization, Docker encapsulates the application in a lightweight, portable container. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments, simplifying dependencies and deployment processes.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Leverages the power of AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment and management. This service automates the deployment of applications to the cloud, managing scaling, load balancing, and monitoring, thereby reducing the complexity of infrastructure management.

### GitHub Actions
Employs GitHub Actions for an automated, seamless deployment pipeline. This CI/CD tool triggers deployments directly from the repository to AWS Elastic Beanstalk upon committing/merging to the main branch. It ensures that the portfolio is always up-to-date in the production environment, facilitating effortless updates and expansions with minimal manual intervention.
